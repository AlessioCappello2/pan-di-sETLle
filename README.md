# pan di sETLle

## Idea
As an Italian guy graduated in Computer Engineering, I wanted to have fun mixing two things I love: Italian breakfast and ETL processes.
- [Mulino Bianco](https://www.mulinobianco.it/home) is one of the most famous - if not the most - brand of baked products in Italy, in particular biscuits
- My major is Computer Engineering, with a particular interest in Software and Data
This project aims to scrape data from each biscuit page on the Mulino Bianco website, like name, image, ingredients and nutrition data, and perform some processing and visualization.

## Structure (work in progress)
I want to automate the process by realizing and deploying a pipeline that each once and a while (i.e. a month may be a reasonable choice) is triggered and launches code.
The point is to extract the biscuits' data, transform, clean and feed them to a PowerBI dashboard.
<ins>Currently</ins>, the process is not automated and the dashboard is not finished, but here I report some screenshots of it.

## Fun fact: why this name?
Well, [Pan di Stelle](https://www.pandistelle.it/) is one of the most popular biscuits from Mulino Bianco, so you can figure it out why this name.
